## How It Works

1. **Telegram Trigger** – Captures incoming messages (text or voice).  
2. **Switch Node** – Detects whether the message is text or voice.  
3. **Transcription (for voice)** – Voice messages are converted to text using **Google Gemini**.  
4. **AI Agent** – Processes the text to generate:
   - **Title** – Concise title based on message content  
   - **Type** – Task, Idea, Question, Observation, or Research  
   - **Category** – Marketing, Personal, Projects, Customers, CRM, Social Media, Offers  
   - **Note Content** – Full message or transcription  
   - **Created At** – Timestamp  
5. **Notion Integration** – Adds the processed note to your Notion database.  
6. **Telegram Feedback** – Sends a confirmation message back to the user.
